### Risk Management System for Stock Trading

This Python-based risk management system helps traders manage their positions and optimize risk across a portfolio of stocks. The system is designed to calculate key metrics like position size, stop-loss, and take-profit levels while ensuring portfolio exposure stays within predefined limits. It provides comprehensive visualizations to enhance understanding of risk and exposure distribution, making it a valuable tool for both individual traders and those managing larger portfolios.

#### Features:
1. **Position Sizing**: 
   - Automatically calculates position size based on the entry price, stop-loss price, and a risk tolerance parameter (set to 2% of total capital by default).
   - Dynamic adjustment of position sizes ensures that traders don't risk more than they can afford to lose on each trade.

2. **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Levels**:
   - Automatically computes stop-loss levels at 5% below the entry price to limit potential losses.
   - Calculates take-profit targets at 10% above the entry price to lock in gains when the stock appreciates.

3. **Exposure Management**:
   - Monitors the total portfolio exposure and ensures it does not exceed 25% of the initial capital, with customizable limits.
   - Generates alerts if the portfolio's exposure surpasses the defined maximum, helping traders maintain balanced portfolios and avoid over-leveraging.

4. **Value at Risk (VaR)**:
   - Calculates the total value at risk (VaR) based on the portfolio's exposure and the trader's predefined risk tolerance, offering a clearer view of the potential downside.

5. **Customizable Parameters**:
   - The system allows customization of various parameters such as risk tolerance, stop-loss percentage, and take-profit percentage, making it flexible to fit different trading styles.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Charts**:
     - Visual representation of stop-loss and take-profit levels for each stock.
     - Portfolio exposure for each stock, including a benchmark line for maximum allowed exposure.
     - Value at Risk (VaR) per stock, showing the capital at risk for each position.
   - **Pie Chart**:
     - Provides a clear breakdown of portfolio exposure, displaying the proportion of capital allocated to each stock, aiding in diversification assessment.

#### How it Works:
- Input a portfolio of stocks with entry prices.
- The system calculates stop-loss and take-profit levels.
- It determines the appropriate position size based on risk tolerance.
- Monitors overall portfolio exposure and ensures it stays within set limits.
- Generates a series of visualizations to help users assess risk and exposure distribution.

#### Technologies Used:
- **NumPy**: For handling mathematical operations and risk calculations.
- **Pandas**: To organize and manipulate stock data efficiently.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For high-quality, detailed visualizations of risk metrics and exposure breakdowns.

#### Potential Enhancements:
- Integrate real-time stock data using financial APIs.
- Add advanced risk metrics like Sharpe ratio or drawdown analysis.
- Implement automated trading by connecting the system with brokerage APIs for placing orders based on the calculated risk metrics.

This project is ideal for stock traders looking for a simple, intuitive tool to manage risks effectively, enabling them to safeguard their capital and optimize their trading performance.
